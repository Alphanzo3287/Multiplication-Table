# Instructions  
You have just been offered your first big software contract for the Jedi Academy. The scope of work is to create a tool for the padawans to learn their times tables. In this program, you will create a 10 x 10  grid of times tables as a cheat sheet for the students to learn. This will display the values of the times tables all the way from 1x1 to 10x10. Make use of formatting tools like inserting tabs, setwidth(), or other formatting to keep the columns nice and neat!


This table must be generated using multiplication and for loops.  The answers must be generated from nested for loops ranging from one to ten elements. Use multiplication and the nested structure to generate the pattern.


Note: Use row for the index of the outer loop. Use col for the index of the inner loop. First get the interior of the multiplication table to print. I recommend using (row * col). Then add the labels for the rows and columns like it's shown in the picture below. A readable grid is the target.

Use a horizontal line to separate the row 1 label from the grid, and use a vertical line to separate the column 1 labels from the grid.

The rest of the grid is optional. You will earn bonus points if you include the vertical and horizontal grid lines throughout the table. 

TIP: Use the Shift + \ key to create vertical lines such as | 




This is what the table should look like in your output window.
